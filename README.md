Solving the Combination Sum Problem
In this article, we’ll explore a classic problem in algorithmic problem-solving: 
finding all unique combinations of numbers that sum up to a target value
This is a common problem in technical interviews and dynamic programming challenges. Let’s break it down step by step.

Approach
This problem is best solved using backtracking. The idea is to explore all possible combinations of numbers and add only valid ones to the result.

Steps:
Start with an empty combination and a total sum of 0.
For each candidate, decide whether to include it in the current combination.
If the current total matches the target, store the combination.
If the total exceeds the target, backtrack to explore other possibilities.

Conclusion
This backtracking approach effectively generates all valid combinations while avoiding duplicates. 
It’s a powerful technique that can be applied to many similar problems in combinatorics.
